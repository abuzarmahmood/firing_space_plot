-- Difference between trials with more and less gaping
        **Can also use data from KM
    1 - How different are EMG signals between clusters?
    2 - How different is population activity between these sets of trials?
    3 - How many trials per "cluster"?
    4 - Is there a temporal (trial dim) component to this change?
    5 - How many neurons show significant changes in activity?
    6 - Where do changes most strongly occur during the trial?
    7 - What happens to identity+palatability information content?
    8 - What happens to the position of changepoints for each epoch?
