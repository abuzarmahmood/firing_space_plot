"""
For GC neurons receiving input from BLA
Are:
    1) their transitions more coherent?
        - That is, do these neurons transition together more tightly
            than the larger population
    2) their transitions earlier?

Will do this for:
    - Det->Iden and Iden->Pal transitions
    - GC rec only, GC send + rec
