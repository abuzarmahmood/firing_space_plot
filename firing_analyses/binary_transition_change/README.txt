For Natasha's project:
1) Looking at GC neurons
2) Are there neurons which show binary changes in firing along the 
    palatability transitions:
        a) Neurons which only show changes in activity for either palatable
            or unpalatable tastants but not for the opposite group
        b) Neurons which show an increase for one hedonic group and a decrease
            for the other hedonic group (and vice versa)
