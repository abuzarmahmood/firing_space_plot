Required installations:
========================================
    - kubectl
        - Kubernetes management CLI
        - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/
    - minikube
        - For quickly deploying local kubernetes clusters
        - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/
    - helm
        - Package manager for kubernetes
        - https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

Steps:
========================================
    1 - Install above requirements
    2 - Start minikube
        - minikube start
    3 - Install dask
        - helm repo add dask https://helm.dask.org/
        - helm repo update
        - export RELEASE="my-dask"
        - helm install ${RELEASE} dask/dask --version 4.1.13 \
            --set scheduler.serviceType=LoadBalancer \
            --set jupyter.serviceType=LoadBalancer 
        **NOTES**:
        - This versioning has been tested 
        - services need to be set as 'LoadBalancer' due to IP config 
            mumbo-jumbo as detailed in reference (3)
            which otherwise prevents an accesible external IP 
    4 - Check thinkgs are running
        - kubectl get pods | grep dask
        - kubectl get svc | grep dask
    5 - Access the dashboards
        - minikube service <SERVICE-NAME> --url
        **NOTES**:
        - For whatever reason, the external IP from the above commands 
            appears as <pending> no matter how long you wait
        - However, according to reference (4), we can get the url from the command noted above 
            - For example "minikube service my-dask-jupyter --url" or 
                minikube service my-dask-scheduler --url
        - Additionally, the scheduler dashboard is NOT ACCESSIBLE from the url given 
            by the dask.distributed.Client output in the python code
    6*- Connecting to dask client over TCP
        - Somehow it automatically connects for c = Client(), but otherwise...
        - c = Client("tcp://192.168.49.2:30208")
        - tcp://<http IP from minikibe service NAME --url>:<forwarded port from kubectl get svc>

Still to figure out:
========================================
    1 - Change number of nodes, and node specs for cluster
    2 - Run cluster with custom Docker Image
        - https://gist.github.com/dims/aafc4b23c6653402f056d5c185fd6cf9
    3 - Parallize over Pymc3 model fits
